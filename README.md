Hi DC!

I have tried to do something nice, but I was getting close to 2 hours, so I will not be able to fully finish the assignment
as I have planned, before some of my considerations a quick disclaimer, I only used Nextjs because it is easy to bootstrap,
so I did not took time to do thing next way.

- Code quality
  I decided to make it composable, this way is easier to organize code and maintain quality.

- Design duplication
  I had a small and low resolution print I tried to be as close as possible but I did not mind small details e.g. font size,
  color, spacings, etc. I am sure it will not match as a perfect duplication, but I tried to be as close as possible.

- Efficiency
  In terms of efficiency for a data driven rendering of the component, I believe composition is a very flexible approach,
  it allows us to map any data we have and render the component as needed.
